# Welcome to Pull Request Club!

This repository is made to help you get accustomed to pull requests and PRC. You may have received this repository as your assignment. We hope you find this helpful as exciting as we do.

# What do I do now?

We are assuming you want to submit a pull request to this very repository. That sounds great! Welcome onboard.

## 1) Create a GitHub Account

You will need a GitHub account to proceed, because this repository currently lives on GitHub. Please login.

## 2) Fork the Repository

You need to "fork" (make a clone of) this repository. See, this repository is called `kyzn/welcome-to-pr`, where `kyzn` is my username. Unless you have right permissions, you won't be able to make any changes to it. There is a useful "Fork" button at top right of this page. If you click that, you will get your own copy: `your-name/welcome-to-pr`. That is yours. You can modify it as you like it. And I don't get to mess with your copy.

## 3) Make some changes!

Now you have your own copy, go wild! Or rather, add your name to `CONTRIBUTORS.md`. You can do this on GitHub.com. Find the file, and then find a pencil button that says "Edit this file" when you hover over it. Add your name, and scroll to the bottom. Go with "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.". You want to merge into `master` branch of `kyzn/welcome-to-prc`. Create more branches for more pull requests.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository to your local machine. Create your branches there, and push back to GitHub. Watch me demo it below. Feel free to rewind for more info on git and branches and more.

If you would like to improve this documentation, you are most welcome! Just submit some more PRs.
