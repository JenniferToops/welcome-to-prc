# Welcome to Pull Request Club!

This repository is made to help you get accustomed to pull requests and PRC. You may have received this repository as your assignment. We hope you find this helpful as exciting as we do.

# What do I do now?

We are assuming you want to submit a pull request to this very repository. That sounds great! Welcome onboard.

## 1) Create a GitHub Account

You will need a GitHub account to proceed, because this repository currently lives on GitHub. Please login.

## 2) Fork the Repository

You need to "fork" (make a clone of) this repository. See, this repository is called `kyzn/welcome-to-pr`, where `kyzn` is my username. Unless you have right permissions, you won't be able to make any changes to it. There is a useful "Fork" button at top right of this page. If you click that, you will get your own copy: `your-name/welcome-to-pr`. That is yours. You can modify it as you like it. And I don't get to mess with your copy.

## 4) Commit your changes

On the same page, scroll to the bottom. Find this commit panel.

![](/images/06-branch.jpg)

Go with "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."

Now unfortunately, this will open a pull request window from your branch to your main. We want to submit it to kyzn's main. So you need to go to https://github.com/kyzn/welcome-to-prc. There, you will see a glowing "Compare & pull request" button. Click that.

That's it! Actually you are pretty much done once you submit the PR. No need to wait until it's merged.

If you would like to improve this documentation, you are most welcome! Just submit some more PRs.
